## Columns

Sourced from "User Guide _ Central Park Squirrel Census Data Collection.docx"

Notable columns:

 * Unique Squirrel ID
   - Identification tag for each squirrel sightings.
   - The tag is comprised of "Hectare ID" + "Shift" + "Date" (MMDD) + "Hectare Squirrel Number."
 * Hectare
   - ID tag, which is derived from the hectare grid used to divide and count the park area.
   - One axis that runs predominantly north-to-south is numerical (1-42), and the axis that runs predominantly east-to-west is alphabetical (A-I).
 * Age
   - Value is either "Adult" or "Juvenile."
 * Primary Fur Color
   - Value is either "Gray," "Cinnamon," or "Black."
 * Location
   - Value is either "Ground Plane" or "Above Ground."
   - Sighters were instructed to indicate the location of where the squirrel was when first sighted.


Editorial note on "Location": this could also correlate to "On the Ground" or "In a Tree", and is being treated as such.
